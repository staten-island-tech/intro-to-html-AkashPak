    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <h2>Akash Pakeerathan Pd.2 
        Mr.Whalen
    </h2><p>My name is Akash. I run track and I high jump. My personal best is 5'2 but I can definitely beat that. I am currently a junior in Staten Island Technical High School.
        I have 2 younger brothers named Abeishan and Adhavan. I play basketball and I play League of Legends. 
      I am currently iron 1 but i can't get out when I am running it down every game. I really enjoy reading ad my favorite is Lo Mein. 
      I have a dog named Sniffles. I also eat a lot. I'm skinny but have a big appetite. If you didn't know, amongst my friends 
      I'm known as frozone. I have many highlights in basketball. My favorite move is the step back 3. If I'm hot, I'm splashing it. 
      I also am an avid manga reader who enjoys dark manga. I've read Berserk and Kimetsu No Yaiba. </p
